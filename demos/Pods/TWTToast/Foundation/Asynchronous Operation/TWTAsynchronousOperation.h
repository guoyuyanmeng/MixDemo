 @abstract Initializes an operation given an operation block to execute.
 
 @param operationBlock The block the operation will execute. See `-[TWTAsynchronousOperation setOperationBlock]` below
 for more details.
 
 @discussion When run, the asynchronous operation executes the developer-provided block, which may perform
 asynchronous tasks. It is the responsibility of the block to invoke 
 `-[TWTAsynchronousOperation finishOperationExecution]` to finish the execution of the operation, usually when the 
 asynchronous task in the block has completed.
 
 It is also recommended (as an optimization) that the block periodically check the
 `-[TWTAsynchronousOperation isCancelled]` flag, and properly abort the execution of its asynchronous task, followed
 by an invocation of `-[TWTAsynchronousOperation finishOperationExecution]` to mark the operation is finished.

 @abstract Set the block to be executed by the operation.
 
 @param operationBlock The block the operation will execute.
 
 @discussion The block takes the operation as an argument, so that it may complete the operation's execution by 
 invoking `-[TWTAsynchronousOperation finishOperationExecution]`. The block should make no assumptions about its 
 execution environment.

 @abstract Tells the operation that it has ended execution and should enter the finished state.
 
 @discussion The developer submitted block should invoke this method to tell the operation that the block's 
 asynchronous tasks have been completed, and it may leave the executing state and enter the finished state. The 
 operation will never leave the executing state on its on, and failure by the developer submitted block to invoke this
 method will result in indefinite execution of this operation.
