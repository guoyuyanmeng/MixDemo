 The TWTBlockActions category of UIControl adds methods for adding and removing actions to a control
 that use blocks instead of typical target objects with action selectors.

 @abstract Adds the specified block as a block action that fires when the specified control events
     occur.
 @param controlEvents A bitmask specifying the control events associated with the block action.
 @param block The block to execute when the specified control events occur. May not be nil.
 @result An opaque object representing the block action. This may be used to remove a block action
     from the receiver using -twt_removeBlockAction.

/*!
 @abstract Removes the specified block action from the receiver.
 @discussion Removing block actions by invoking -removeTarget:action:forControlEvents:, e.g., with a
     nil target and NULL action will also remove block actions. However, doing so will defer
     releasing the memory associated with the block action until the receiver is deallocated. Using
     this method will release the memory earlier, if possible. The memory footprint of a block action
     is small, so this should not be a huge concern.
 @param action The opaque block action object that was returned by -twt_addBlockActionForControlEvents:block:
