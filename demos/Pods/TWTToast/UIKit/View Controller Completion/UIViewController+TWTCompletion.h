@interface UIViewController (TWTCompletion)

/*!
 Presented view controllers need a way to signal to their presenter when they are done. twt_completion
 facilitates this pattern. The presenter sets the twt_completion block and then when the presented view
 controller is done, it calls twt_finish or twt_cancel. This property is set to nil just before the block is
 invoked to break any strong reference cycles.
