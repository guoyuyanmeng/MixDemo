/*!
 @abstract Returns a set of property keys that should be excluded from Mantle operations on the receiver’s 
     instances.
 @discussion Subclasses should override this method to return any keys that should not be automatically
     encoded/decoded or included in calculations of -hash, -isEqual:, or -description. The default 
     implementation returns the empty set.

     One important use of this method is to handle inverse relationships. Mantle can’t detect circular 
     references, and thus its default implementations of -description, -hash, and -isEqual: will recurse
     infinitely unless inverse relationships are excluded. By implementing this method and returning keys
     for the inverse relationships, the aforementioned methods will just work.
 
     Subclasses should take care that their implementation of this method adds their excluded property keys
     to those of their superclass’s. A typical implementation looks like:
 
         return [[super excludedPropertyKeys] setByAddingObjectsFromArray:@[ o1, o2, …, oN ]];
 @result A set of property keys that should be excluded from Mantle operations on the receiver’s instances.
